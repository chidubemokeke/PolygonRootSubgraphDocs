# Polygon Root Subgraph Introduction

Polygon has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Polygon smart contracts.

This subgraph is can be used to query Polygon data.

Subgraph information is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called Indexers.
